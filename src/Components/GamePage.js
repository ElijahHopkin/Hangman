This represents the interactive display. It will have a route added from the homepage for clarity.
Includes:
    -'end game' button (does that mean they die or do they just go back to home?)
    -image of the scaffold( background, or can I find an interactive cartoon to go with it?)
    -User input for letter guesses
    -button to submit guess
    -a log of previous guesses
    -either cartoon body parts that will be attached(does the user get to select what gets added in what order? Further, does that include a 'click action' or a drag and drop in the selected 'body' field?) or a list of named body parts
    -Shakespearean epithets or computer commentary that matches correct or incorrect guesses.
    -Is there a way that a player can earn money that will allow them to purchase letters if needed?
